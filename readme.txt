Displays the lyrics to the Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up" in the top right corner of the admin panel.

== Description ==

"Never Gonna Give You Up" is a slight modification of the "Hello, Dolly" plugin that comes with Wordpress. When activated, it displays the lyrics to the Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up", which has become an internet phenomenon, in the top right corner of the admin panel. I'm not sure if this is technically classified as a rickroll, but I'm sure someone will get some enjoyment out of it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `never.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Laugh every time you write a new post

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why? =

Because I've been rickrolled at least once a day for the past two weeks, and I decided that it was time to embrace Rick Astley's gift to the world. Or something.

= Will it work with "Hello, Dolly"? =

Just a second, let me check.
Um, sort of. They both work, but the lyrics overlap each other. If you really want them both at once, edit your "never.php" file and change the line "top: 2.3em;" to "top: 3.3em".
